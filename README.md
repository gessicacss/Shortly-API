## How to run

To run this, you'll have to install PostgreSQL and create a table to acess the database.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

3. Create a **.env** file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. This file should not be committed to GitHub for security reasons. It should look like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/<database_name>

    <username>: your PostgreSQL username.
    <password>: your PostgreSQL password.
    <database_name>: database name which you want to connect.
```

4. Restore the database dump with the following command:

```
psql -U <username> -d <database_name> -f dump.sql

Replace <username> with the PostgreSQL username that should be used for the database.
Replace <database_name> with the name of the database where the dump should be restored.
```

5. Run the back-end with

```
npm start
```

6. Access http://localhost:5000 on your browser to run the API.
